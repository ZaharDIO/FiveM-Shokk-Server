# Randolio: LS Car Meet

**No framework needed**

The LS car meet. This place absolutely fascinates me from GTA Online and like usual, I wanted to recreate it. After countless hours reading decomp, translating and testing I have managed to piece together a almost perfect replica from GTA Online.

Alternative folders provide other configs created by other people using different MLO's. Please read them if you wish to use them. Not providing support.

**Information**:

* Every vehicle along with it's set modifications and cosmetics has been placed into it's position for the IPL.
* The two synchronized scenes I discovered for 'Mimi' and the 'Race Organizer' have also been created with exact replica of their personal vehicles.
* Peds were slightly difficult with limited information on their spawns for that particular scene and only partial animation dicts from what I could see. This forced me to open up rpf files to try and find the exact dicts and anims as they were not available on plebmaster. Furthermore, I watched a dozen youtube videos of random people entering the car meet in GTA Online which then lead to me creating all my peds from what I could visually see in those videos lol.
* Some of the animations I found actually had props that could be attached to them (phone, smoke and what I guessed was a cup?) so I created those when that animation would get called. 
* Animation prop offsets may not be entirely accurate but I did the best I could.

* All entities are client side and non networked. They are only spawned within range and despawned when out of range. I found 80.0 to be a good distance using ox lib points.
* The first time you enter in that fivem session, you may notice the cars, peds etc load a little slow. This is because they need to be initially loaded on your client. Any time you enter after that within that same fivem session, they'll spawn almost instantly.
* All cars visually will be the same for everyone but **most** ped variations will not. I didn't feel like sitting there and setting components for every single ped. Instead, their components and props are set at random on each spawn, adds a nice bit of variety. (You may run into some weird issues where their hair is poking through a hat but oh well)

**THIS IS SET TO THE DEFAULT CAR MEET IPL WHICH WILL REQUIRE BOB74_IPL (WHICH MOST SERVERS SHOULD HAVE BY DEFAULT ANYWAY). IT IS POSSIBLE TO MOVE ALL THE SPAWNED ENTITIES INTO A CUSTOM CAR MEET MLO, LIKE GABZ AS AN EXAMPLE BUT THIS WILL REQUIRE YOU TO EDIT THE COORDINATES OF EVERY ENTITY IN THE CONFIG. I WILL NOT DO IT FOR YOU OR SUPPORT YOU WITH THAT. I ALREADY DID THE HARD PART.**

**You may use this in your server and adjust to your own personal needs but you are not allowed to redistribute it.**
